## 2021

My first challenge of 2021 is about learning AWS Associate Developer certificate. It's more interesting then I thought. You will not only learn about the AWS products but also about some knowledge help you have a bigger view about application deployment and architecture. For example:

- Load balancing
- [Blue green](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/blue-green-deployment) deployment
- Security
- Serverless architecture
- Docker

And here is the list of resources I use for learning, hope it's useful for you too. :)
