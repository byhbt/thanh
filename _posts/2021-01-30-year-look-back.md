### Look back 2020

From my first launch the blog [one year ago](https://www.thanh.xyz/blog/blog-launch/), look back.

Yeah, I have kept the site up for a year. Interstingly.

This is just a small blog with limited content, luckily, there still some visitors.

One of them has emailed to me to ask for supporting for an issue, that make me feel I am on the right path, at least my content here is useful not only me.

### Look forward to 2021

I updated the skin and migrate the website to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I want to improve my writing skill, also share more technical stuffs on this blog.

Thank you for reading!
