### Eco System

One year ago, I has planned to learn [Ruby](https://www.thanh.xyz/ruby/learn-ruby-on-rails-in-a-week/). Luckily, this year I have a chance to learn [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

As other languages, Elixir shares some similarities:
- Package Manager: https://hex.pm
- Web Framework: https://phoenixframework.org
- Elixir's interactive shell: https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html
- Learning site: https://elixirschool.com/en

And definitely, there are some new things:

### 1. Pattern Matching
(Updating)

### 2. Pipe Operator
(Updating)
