As the first sight, I think Python is easy to learn as PHP,
the syntax is quite simple and clear, huge tutorials, library
from the community.

But actually not like that, anything if you try to gain deeper knowledge
it always take time.

There is some new term i learn from Python (3):

### Data structure

#### Dictionary:
Look like associate array in PHP, with a list of key and value.

#### Tuple:
Just like array but immutable (cannot update/change/delete element(s)), and use (1,2,3,4)

#### Set


#### Yield

#### Iterable


#### Generator
