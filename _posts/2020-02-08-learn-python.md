IMO, I think Python is easy to learn as PHP,
the syntax is quite simple and clear, huge tutorials, library
from the community.

But not like that, anything if you try to gain deeper knowledge
it always takes time.

There is some new term I learn from Python (3):

### Data structure

#### Dictionary:
Look like associates array in PHP, with a list of key and value.

#### Tuple:
Just like array but immutable (cannot update/change/delete element(s)), and use (1,2,3,4)

#### Set


#### Yield

#### Iterable


#### Generator
