This week I plan to learn React.

Again, we won't read books, just focus on build some examples from simple to advance.

Sure, I will read a book later on to solidify my knowledge

1. Build tac-tic-toe game
[https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

2. Build comments list

3. [Build currency exchange](https://github.com/byhbt/4xrates)
