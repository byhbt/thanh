I focus on **building** instead of *reading*. Why? Because reading and looking for latest materials are kind of procrastination.
While write code:
- Debug to see the flow
- Question... question... question... every single piece of code.
- Read the docs, then read the books...

### Step 1: Setup
- ```rails server``` is enough, no Docker.
- Editor: Sublime, no RubyMine...

Notice: Focus on the Ruby and Rails. Don't spend time on IDE, productivity...

### Step 2: Syntax
- Learning basic Ruby syntax: [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby)

### Step 3: Build

#### 2. CRUD App:
- [https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app)
- Repo: https://github.com/byhbt/rails-crud

#### 3. Shoutr App:

#### "Unit test": add test above applications.

### Step 4: Review

Make sure understand Rail workflow:

1. Debugging
2. Logging/Exception handling
3. Framework
- Routing
- Controller
- View
- Model
- Migration
- Validation
- Relationship
4. ```rails``` command
5. JS
6. SCSS
