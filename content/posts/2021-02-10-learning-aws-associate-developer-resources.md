## Introduction

My first challenge of 2021 is about learning AWS Associate Developer certificate. It's more interesting than I thought.
You will not only learn about the AWS products but also about some knowledge help you have a bigger view about application deployment and architecture. For example:

- Load balancing
- [Blue green](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/blue-green-deployment) deployment
- Security
- Serverless architecture
- Docker
- [Caching strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/mem-ug/Strategies.html)

And here is the list of resources I use for learning, hope it's useful for you too. :)

## I. Materials

### Courses:

## II. How to learn

### 1. Don't waste your time of searching for material

I follow the structure of the [Udemy AWS course above](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01) and reading AWS Docs
- [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)
- [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)
- [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)

From my experience, there is __no best material__. We can choose 1 course or book, let consider it as the **base material**, then follow it from the start to finish.

Along the way, we will reference to other materials when the concepts in base material are not clear enough, or you don't understand it.

### 2. "Get your feet wet"

Not just reading or listening, you should take notes, re-read the notes... It helps you recall the knowledge before taking the exam.

Build some funny ideas base on what you learnt, for example in my case, I try to build my blog and [a static website](https://proud-forest-011b24b00.azurestaticapps.net) on S3, also the [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/static).

### 3. Looking futher

When you learn Amazon, you should spend 5% of learning time (just a few) to reference to Microsoft/Google Cloud to see the equivilent services.
